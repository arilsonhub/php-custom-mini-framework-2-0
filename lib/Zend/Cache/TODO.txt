Priority 1 :

- end of "Page" frontend (clone of "jpcache")
	=> introduce conditionnal HTTP requests (304 Not Modified...)


Priority 2 :

- unit testing for Page, frontend and APC/Memcached backend (seems to be difficult)
- an integrated cache for Zend_Controler ?
- an integrated cache for Zend XMLRPC ?
- improve logging feature with debug support (only warnings are implemented now)
